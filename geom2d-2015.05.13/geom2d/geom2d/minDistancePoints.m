%MINDISTANCEPOINTS Minimal distance between several points
%
%   DIST = minDistancePoints(PTS)
%   Returns the minimum distance between all couple of points in PTS. PTS
%   is a N-by-D array of values, N being the number of points and D the
%   dimension of the points.
%
%   DIST = minDistancePoints(PTS1, PTS2)
%   Computes for each point in PTS1 the minimal distance to every point of
%   PTS2. PTS1 and PTS2 are N-by-D arrays, where N is the number of points,
%   and D is the dimension. Dimension must be the same for both arrays, but
%   number of points can be different.
%   The result is an array the same length as PTS1.
%
%
%   DIST = minDistancePoints(..., NORM)
%   Uses a user-specified norm. NORM=2 means euclidean norm (the default), 
%   NORM=1 is the Manhattan (or "taxi-driver") distance.
%   Increasing NORM growing up reduces the minimal distance, with a limit
%   to the biggest coordinate difference among dimensions. 
%   
%
%   [DIST I J] = minDistancePoints(PTS)
%   Returns indices I and J of the 2 points which are the closest. DIST
%   verifies relation:
%   DIST = distancePoints(PTS(I,:), PTS(J,:));
%
%   [DIST J] = minDistancePoints(PTS1, PTS2, ...)
%   Also returns the indices of points which are the closest. J has the
%   same size as DIST. It verifies relation: 
%   DIST(I) = distancePoints(PTS1(I,:), PTS2(J,:));
%   for I comprised between 1 and the number of rows in PTS1.

%   Examples:
%   % minimal distance between random planar points
%       points = rand(20,2)*100;
%       minDist = minDistancePoints(points);
%
%   % minimal distance between random space points
%       points = rand(30,3)*100;
%       [minDist ind1 ind2] = minDistancePoints(points);
%       minDist
%       distancePoints(points(ind1, :), points(ind2, :))
%   % results should be the same
%
%   % minimal distance between 2 sets of points
%       points1 = rand(30,2)*100;
%       points2 = rand(30,2)*100;
%       [minDists inds] = minDistancePoints(points1, points2);
%       minDists(10)
%       distancePoints(points1(10, :), points2(inds(10), :))
%   % results should be the same

% HISTORY:
% 22/06/2005 compute sqrt only at the end (faster), and change behaviour
%   for 2 inputs: compute min distance for each point in PTS1. 
%   Also add support for different norms.
% 15/08/2005 make difference when 1 array or 2 arrays of points
% 25/10/2006 also returns indices of closest points
% 30/10/2006 generalize to points of any dimension
% 28/08/2007 code cleanup, add comments and help
